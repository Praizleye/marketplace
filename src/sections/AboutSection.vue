          Marketplace Stakeholders Africa is a revolutionary conference
          organised by Maime Innovation Foundation, in collaboration with The
          Metropolitan Church to bring together captains of industries,
          marketplace leaders, creatives, market experts, innovators, business
          men and women in different sectors across African countries. The event
          will serve as a forum for open dialogue with industry stakeholders and
          the press in an open intelligent conversation to identify prevalent
          problems related to their respective industry and proffer contemporary
          solutions to each of the identified industrial problems by making
          these respective industries work through production intelligence. The
          concept of production intelligence is basically the instinctual
          ability to use oneâ€™s knowledge, past experience, information,
          understanding, insight, reasoning or set of skillsto improve the
          African economy by intelligently inventing a brand, software, machine,
          robot, artificial intelligence, product, or produce a service that can
          proffer solution to specific real life problem in Africa or solve a
          specific problem in a community, organisation or the marketplace. The
          conference will give every young entrepreneur, marketplace leader,
          students and innovator the opportunity to gain exposure about diverse
          industries in the marketplace from a global perspective, and thereby
          create an enabling environment for investors to maximise every
          untapped potential and resources spread across the African continent.
